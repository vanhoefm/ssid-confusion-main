\begin{abstract}
When connecting to a protected \wifi{} networks, the client and network mutually authenticate each other, and subsequently protect all transmitted data frames.
Once connected, the user can see which network they are connected to, and make security decisions based on this.
However, in this paper we demonstrate that a client can be tricked into connecting to a different (protected) \wifi{} network than the one it intended to connect to.
The root cause is a design flaw in the IEEE 802.11 standard: the network name (SSID) is not always authenticated.
We demonstrate the practical impact of this attack, find that all devices are vulnerable to the attack, and propose backwards-compatible defenses as well as updates to the standard.

\section{Introduction}

When connecting to a protected \wifi{} network, all transmitted data will be encrypted and authenticated.
One would also reasonably expect that the name of the \wifi{} network as shown by the client, called the Service Set Identifier~(SSID), it also trustworthy.
In other words, if a client believes (and shows to the user) that it is connected to the protected \wifi{} network \verb|university|, \red{then one would expect that an adversary cannot trick the client into showing a different SSID}.

We first highlight that significant trust is (indirectly) placed on the SSID that a client thinks it is connected to.
One example is that many VPNs, such as Clouldflare's WARP VPN, hide.me, and Windscribe, can automatically disable the VPN with connected to a trusted \wifi{} network.
These apps recognize the \wifi{} network based on its SSID.

Our SSID confusion attack can trick a vulnerable client into connecting to, and mutually authenticating with, a different network than it thinks it is connecting to.
The root cause is that, although credentials are mutually authenticated when connecting to a protected \wifi{} network, the name of the network is \emph{not} authenticated.
Only when using home networks with WPA1/2 or version~2 of WPA3 is the \red{SSID} indirectly authenticated.

We can make the victim connect to SSID B but the user thinks it is connected to SSID A.
This works against Enterprise networks that use the same radius server and against home WEP and \red{WPA3 version 1} networks that use the same password.

Several backwards-compatible defenses exist to prevent the attack.
First, beacon protection can be enabled, and the client must then capture a beacon before completing \red{the handshake} and verify the authenticity of \red{this reference beacon}.
Because the beacon contains the SSID of the network, authenticating the beacon means that the SSID is now also authenticated.
Another defense for home networks is to use a unique password for every SSID, and for enterprise networks one defense is to use a different \red{CommonName} for the RADIUS server for each SSID.
Ideally, the IEEE 802.11 standard that underpins \wifi{} is also updated to always authenticated the SSID in the \fourway{} handshake, which would assure that the SSID is always authenticated.

To summarize, our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We propose new threat models that highlight the importance of authenticating a \wifi{} network's SSID (Section~\ref{sec:motivation}).

    \item We introduce the SSID confusion attack and systematically inspect all \wifi{} authentication methods to determine whether they are vulnerable (Section~\ref{sec:attack}).

    \item
    We evaluate our attack against various clients and networks, and test a second optimized variant of our attack (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}).
	
	\item We propose %TODO: (backwards-compatible) 
	defenses against our attack (Section~\ref{sec:defenses}).
\end{itemize}
Finally, we give an overview of related work in Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork}, and we conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

This section will introduce relevant authentication methods defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard that underpins \wifi{}~\cite{ieee80211-2020}.

\subsection{Home and Enterprise Authentication}

Typically, we can identify two types of protected \wifi{} networks: home and Enterprise networks.
Home networks are protected by a pre-shared password that all users posses.
In contrast, Enterprise networks use the 802.1X protocol for authentication.
This enables the network to use any Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) it desires: authentication can be done based on a username and password, using certificates, using one-time passwords, and so on.

Overview of authentication? Mention that the certificate is verified, and/or the username and password, but never the SSID.

Contrast with home network: the SSID is verified during the handshake.
Cannot sneakily make a victim connect to a different network, even if both networks use the same password.

\subsection{Infrastructure and Mesh Networks}

Broadly speaking, a \wifi{} network can operate in \red{multiple modes}, with two of the most common ones being infrastructure and mesh mode.
In infrastructure networks, there is a single central Access Point~(AP), and all clients connect and authenticate with this AP.
%TODO: More detail. Who to authenticiate with?
\red{In contrast, in a mesh network there is no central fixed node.}

\red{---TODO: What about beacon protection in mesh networks? And what about groups keys in general?---}

\subsection{Authentication Method Reuse}

In practice, it can often occur that a client can use the same authentication methods, and corresponding credentials, to connect to different \red{SSIDs}.
A common example is when different SSIDs are advertised for each frequency band, e.g., there might be two networks called \verb|eduroam| and \verb|eduroam-2.4| for the 5 and 2.4~GHz band, respectively.
This is sometimes done because certain clients do not automatically use the \red{typically faster} 5 GHz band, and with this naming, by default devices will use the 5~GHz band, unless the client explicitly connects to the 2.4~GHz SSID.
% We cite several sources where enabling MFP or similar would cause issues, so one network is basic, and the other has all the extensions.
Additionally, networks in \red{newer} frequency bands typically support more features, including security features such as Management Frame Protection~\cite{schepers2021let}, and are therefore on average more secure than the 2.4~GHz SSID.
%TODO: Other security features?
%TODO: What about 6 GHz?

Another use-case is where a university employee can use the same credentials \red{and RADIUS configuration} to connect to both their own university network and the eduroam networks.

\red{---The 2.4 variant can be broadcasted by older APs that are more likely to be vulnerable to attacks, such as KRACK or FragAttacks. Can't leak the key but still leak/inject traffic sort of similar to Enterprise attack.---}

\subsection{Auto-Disabling VPNs on Trusted Networks}

CloudFlare's 1.1.1.1: can be abused to disable a victim's VPN.

\subsection{Different SSID per Frequency Band}

2.4 vs 5 GHz network, different management frame protection options.

2.4 AP may be older and vulnerable to KRACK/FragAttacks.

\section{The SSID Confusion Attack}
\label{sec:attack}

In this section, we introduce our SSID confusion attack, which was assigned \red{CVE-2023-XXXXXXX}, and systematically analyze which authentication methods are vulnerable.

\subsection{Attack Details}

\input{fig-ssid-confusion}

\red{---TODO: Diagram: Advertise different SSID on another channel, forward frames to the real AP, handshake succeeds.---}

\red{Can make it connect to an SSID it has not ever connected to before.}

\input{table-authmethods}

\subsection{Home Networks}

\subsubsection{WEP}
% https://www.mathyvanhoef.com/2015/03/codegate-2015-goodcrypto-advanced-wep.html
The old WEP protocol is also vulnerable, \red{which is still used by 1\% of all \wifi{} networks}.

\subsubsection{WPA1/2}

\subsubsection{WPA3}

\subsection{Enterprise Networks} % Enterprise networks 802.1X

For an Enterprise network, a subsequent Fast BSS Transition would also still work, since it is not based on the SSID either.

\subsection{Mesh Networks}

With Mesh networks: ``In order to create a secure peering, mesh STAs first authenticate each other and create a mesh PMKSA. This can be done using either SAE or IEEE Std 802.1X. A mesh STA shall support SAE authentication (see 12.4). A mesh STA may support IEEE 802.1X authentication (see 4.10).''
That is followed by AMPE which does not verify the SSID.
So the attack is also possible for mesh networks.

\subsection{Other}

\subsubsection{Fast BSS Transition}

\subsubsection{FILS (Public Key)}

\subsubsection{Other}

\red{What about AP PeerKey?}

Technically also the TPK handshake for client to client communication.
But what's the point, no practical impact or realistic threat model?

% https://mrncciew.com/2023/09/25/fils-fast-initial-link-setup/
FILS Public Key authentication also looks vulnerable.
Is it realistic that two networks share the same public key?

\red{---TODO: What about the short SSID in the FILS frames?---}

\section{Optimization and evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

%TODO: We won't actually request this CVE...
\red{This vulnerability in} \verb|wpa_supplicant| \red{was assigned CVE-2023-XXXXXXX}.

\subsection{Connection-Only Attack}

Once a client has connected, does it check the SSID in the received beacons?
If not, the attacker only needs to be present while connecting, and can then move the client back to the original channel.

\subsection{Evaluation}

We make a test tool again? So no full attack, but check all the preconditions.

\red{---Test 1: configure using ``weak'' SSID. But manually change SSID to ``strong'' one in beacon, probe response (it is not in the association response). That simulates an attack. Does the client connect? Any other frames to change the SSID in?---}

\red{---Test 2: change the SSID in the beacon only after connecting. Both with and without beacon protection.---}

Our tool supports all major authentication methods: WEP, WPA2/3, WPA3 with SAE-Loop and SAE-Constant, PEAP, TTLS, EAP-PWD, and so on.
Additionally, test can be performed while the network is using \red{MFP} or \red{beacon protection}.

\subsection{Enterprise Evaluation}

\red{Telenet plaintext behavior, reply time}

Example attack scenarios Enterprise:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eduroam and local \wifi{} network that use the same authentication.
	Scrape eduroam and look if the radius server is also used in other configuration guides.
	\item Telenet Wi-Free and KU Leuven university login.
	Home users can now intercept traffic!
\end{itemize}

We can test these attacks at multiple devices as well.

Based on scraping of the tools, we found 6 vulnerable organizations:
eduroam.technion.ac.il
nac.temple.edu
radius.kuleuven.be
radius.vse.cz
radius.york.ac.uk
val.ul.ie

\red{---TODO: Also check for public key reuse?---}

Example attack scenarios WPA3.
Note that an attack only makes sense if the adversary does not know the password, otherwise they can just put up a rogue AP.

Public \wifi{} Networks:

\begin{itemize}
	\item TELENET Wi-Free
	\item citiwifi in Luxembourg and \verb|luxfuturelab.lu|
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Impact of Channel Validation}

\red{---TODO: What about performing the attack when channel validation is enabled? Probably just do a wormhole attack or be out of range of the original AP.---}

\section{Defenses}
\label{sec:defenses}

\subsection{Beacon Protection}

\subsubsection{Experiments}

\red{---Can we still perform the attack when beacon protection is being used?---}
%Doesn't look like it on Linux, see mac80211/mlme.c.

\subsubsection{Verification of pre-auth beacon}

Normally a reference beacon should be saved, which is then checked once connected.
This is currently not done by Linux.

\red{Demonstrate that the attack is prevented in all cases when the AP and client use beacon protection, with reference beacon comparison, and optionally with SSID checking in received beacons.}

Older networks will use a hidden SSID and in that case beacon protection cannot be used to prevent the attack.
But enabling beacon protection AND advertising the SSID will prevent the attack, since the victim will then either get the real beacon with SSID or will be unable to verify a forged beacon.

\subsection{Other Defenses}

Backwards-compatible:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use a different RADIUS server for each network.
	For home networks, use a different password for each different SSID.
	%\item Use a different inner/outer identity for each network? Depends on whether the RADIUS server knows the network the request came from.
	\item Modify the client OS to include a flag whether the authenticity of the SSID is currently verified.
	Alternatively, instead of giving access to the SSID, the OS could make available the CommonName used in enterprise networks.
\end{itemize}

Protocol changes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The 4-way handshake itself could (again) include the SSID.
\end{itemize}
